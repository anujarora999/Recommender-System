# Recommender-System

A product recommendation is basically a filtering system that seeks to predict and
show the items that a user would like to purchase. 

It may not be entirely accurate, but if it shows you what you like then it is doing its job right.

 
Recommender systems have become increasingly popular in recent years, and are utilized in a variety of areas including movies, music, news, books, research articles, search queries, social tags, and products in general. 

Mostly used in the digital domain, majority of todayâ€™s E-Commerce sites like eBay, Amazon, Alibaba etc make use of their proprietary recommendation algorithms in order to better serve the customers with the products they are bound to like.
